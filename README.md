# gpxtrack

A simple PWA to be installed on your phone, helping you follow a GPX track and see your position on it.

## Installation

1. Get the code from GitHub: `git clone 'https://github.com/brownrl/gpxtrack.git'`
2. Host it somewhere and browse to it with your phone. (Herd share?)
3. Save it to your home screen.

### OR...

Browse to https://brownrl.github.io/gpxtrack/ and save it to your home screen. It's a PWA, so it will save as an 'app' on your phone.

## Usage

1. Export a GPX file from your favorite app to your files.
2. Open the GPX app on your phone.
3. Tap the rocket icon in the bottom left corner.
4. Select the GPX file you exported.
5. Start moving. I personally prefer to use a bicycle, but it works with walking too.

The globe button will open a drawer with quick links to Google Maps with certain types of locations already searched for you (lodging, restaurants, etc.).

## Development

- Clone the repo.
- Create your own Mapbox API key at https://mapbox.com.
  - Add your API key to the `index.html` file.
  - My key is there, but it will only work for my domains.
- Ideally, I use the local domain name: 'gpxtrack.test'.
- Have fun and make your own Mapbox style.
- Start coding whatever you want. I am 100% open to PRs and ideas.
